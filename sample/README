Creating Front End:
1. Run "npx create-react-app client" to create the client
2. Activate the virtual environment "venv\Scripts\acitvate" from sample folder.
(If faced error with "scripts is disabled on this system", run "Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned" under administrative powershell)
